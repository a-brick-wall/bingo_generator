# bingo_generator
A python app to generate randomized bingo cards with text instead of numbers. Includes a somewhat creative function to wrap and scale text within a box. I think there's a fancier way to do it but this method uses brute force for short phrases or an imperfect algorithm for longer ones. You can have 1 or 2 cards per sheet. Everything should scale automatically but you can also adjust the spacing in the config file.
